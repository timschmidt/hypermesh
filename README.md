Boolmesh is a pure Rust library for performing robust and efficient mesh boolean operations. It is a full-from-scratch Rust implementation inspired by [Elalish’s Manifold](https://manifoldcad.org/docs/html/classmanifold_1_1_manifold.html), which is well known for its robustness and is now part of OpenSCAD.

The codebase is clean and minimal, with dependencies only on `glam`—which provides SIMD acceleration—and optionally on `rayon` for multi-threading support. Besides being robust, Boolmesh is also very fast. For example, generating a Menger Sponge of depth 4 (the model shown on the right) takes only around 8 seconds on an Apple Silicon M4 using single-threading, and around 4 seconds with multi-threading enabled. Also, the library supports both 32-bit and 64-bit floating point arithmetic.

## Usage
The usage is intentionally simple, as the library exposes only one main function for end users. To perform a boolean operation, construct a mesh buffer structure (called a `Manifold`) from vertex positions and face indices, then call `compute_boolean()` to obtain the result.

Note: Input meshes must be manifold, meaning they must not contain boundaries or overlapping geometry.

``` rust  
let mfd_0 = Manifold::new(&positions_0, &indices_0).unwrap();    
let mfd_1 = Manifold::new(&positions_1, &indices_1).unwrap(); 
let result: Manifold = compute_boolean(&mfd_0, &mfd_1, OpType::Subtract).unwrap();
```

Examples such as a Menger Sponge generator and simple mesh boolean samples can be found in the examples folder.

```
 cargo run --package boolmesh --release --example menger_sponge --features=bevy,rayon,f32
```
In versions following v0.1.9, primitive generators and transformation methods have been removed from the Manifold struct. This change reflects a shift in focus toward the library's core boolean engine. Given that primitive generation and transformation matrices can now be easily handled by external utilities or AI-assisted coding, I have decided to keep the codebase lean and specialized.

## Roadmap
Planned upcoming implementations include:
- Signed Distance Field (SDF)
- UV value and mesh ordering inheritance for output meshes
